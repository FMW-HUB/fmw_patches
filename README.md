WIP Patch Repository for Fantasy Maiden Wars Complete Box - Dream of the Stray Dreamer

# Instructions
1. Download [xdeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/) to apply the `*.xdelta` patches in this repo.
2. Browse your local files for your installation of FMWCB - DSoD from Steam.
3. Make a copy of your original `data.win` file; rename the old file to `data_old.win`.
4. In xdeltaUI, select the `*.xdelta` patch to apply to your new `data.win` file. Make sure the output file is renamed to `data.win` and its destination is the same folder as the `fmw_dsod.exe`.
5. Patch should be applied, and the new changes will take effect next time you play the game.
6. If anything fails in prev steps, restore from the original `data_old.win` and rename it to `data.win`.
