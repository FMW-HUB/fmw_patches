###1.2.4.1###
- Migrate previous mod changes from 1.2.3.x

- Dynamically expand and draw the Abilities list if more than 4 abilities are present in the UI. This fixes previous text overflow UI bugs that did not take into account units (player or enemy) that had more than 4 abilities at a time.

- Fix UI bug where Distortion Barrier appears multiple times in the Abilities list if more than one Portable Gap is equipped.

- Remove Radiator Pack PS fix from modding changes as it is now natively implemented in the vanilla version starting from 1.2.4.
